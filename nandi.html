        Residents of Bangalore have discovered the picturesque natural beauty of a
         hill fortress that is located quite close <br>to the main city.<br><br>

Nandi Hills, a small albeit beautiful town, is just 60 km away from the city of Bangalore 
and has emerged as the perfect weekend <br>getaway for its people.<br> <br>

Even though it is most well-known for its viewpoints and its greenery, Nandi Hills is also a
 popular historical fortress that is home to a number of<br> temples, monuments and shrines.<br> <br> 

 The place was previously used by the famous ruler Tipu Sultan as a summer retreat, and several 
 traces of the Sultanâ€™s life and legacy can be found in the area.<br>  His summer residence can still
  be found  in Nandi Hills. <br> <br> 

The house was called Tashk-e-Jannat, whose painted walls, intricate archways, high pillars
 and artfully crafted ceilings attract tourists and visitors <br> even today.<br> <br> 

Nandi Hills is also home to some famous temples and shrines such as the Bhoga Nandeeshwara Temple, 
dedicated to Lord Shiva and his <br>  companions- Parvati and Nandi. <br> <br> 

This temple is also an architectural wonder and pilgrimage spot because it is one of the oldest 
temples in the area.<br> <br>  

Apart from its historical sites and heritage monuments, Nandi Hills is also famous for its 
trekking trails,<br>  cycling routes and adventure sports such as paragliding. It is truly the perfect
 place to enjoy a peaceful retreat <br> from life in the city and take in some of the best views the 
 countryside has<br>  to offer.
