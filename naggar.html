                A town that seems to have paused its reels in the ‘60s,
                Rumsu is an ode to the simpler <br> times with its archaic vibe.
                People here still live in fragile wooden houses that appear <br>to be almost made
                by hand for a fairy tale set. The food here is also just as simple,
                but <br>manifold hearty and delicious. And as you can expect from a gravely
                offbeat village of<br> Himachal Pradesh, Rumsu has pure & utterly charming views of the
                green Himalayas of <br>the Kullu Valley. Our almost antediluvian and mostly wooden home
                in Rumsu sits on a <br>small ridge, with green hills and the snow-capped Himalayas right
                across from it. The <br>rooms here treat you with velvety beds and delectable views,
                private balconies and <br>ample space to unwind. Come here for a simple, leisurely holiday
                focused at spending <br>time with your loved ones or self and artistic exploration, for
                there’s little to do here<br> but a lot to take in.
